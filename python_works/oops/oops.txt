OOPs - Object oriented programming.
        a way of programming in which we bundle data and behaviour throgh class and object.

object --> an entity with data and behaviour.
class ---> collection of objects/blueprint.

eg:

    car (class)

        brand --> toyota            (attributes)
        model --> fortuner          (attributes)
        color --> phantom black     (attributes)
        v.no ---> kl02              (attributes)

syntax:

    class class_name:
        properties
        behaviour

    object
